Description             : REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT NOTES YOU NEED TO READ!!!
	                  - You need GOTHICTX.WAD to run this map!  Links to
                            download it are at the end of the text file.
			  - This map is ENORMOUS.  If you have anything less
                            than a 1Ghz processor, don't even bother.
                          - This is probably the hardest map ever made that
                            isn't nuts.wad, with well over 3000 monsters on UV.
                            That being said, I would highly recommend HMP
                            difficulty for most players, as that is more
                            equal to normal UV difficulties.

                          Since the original "The Spire" did not, oddly
                          enough, feature spires of any sort, Celestial
                          takes place in and outside of an enormous tower.
                          The map is quite non-linear, check your automap
                          if you get lost.  Also keep in mind: ALL KEYS ARE
                          DIFFERENT!  That means blue keycard is NOT the same
                          as blue skullkey, etc.

			  Feedback is appreciated!

                          of this map were heavily inspired by the first two

			  Huy Pham for Deus Vult, another large source of
                          inspiration.
