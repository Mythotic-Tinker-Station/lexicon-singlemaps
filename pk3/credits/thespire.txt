Description             : Okay, for starters:  THIS LEVEL IS LARGE.  VERY,
                          VERY, VERY LARGE.  It has ~2400 sectors and
                          ~2300 monsters on UV.  I would NOT recommend 
                          playing this level if you have a really old 
                          computer.  Second, this map is pretty hard.
                          100% kills and secrets on skill 4 is possible,
                          but difficult (I've done it with a lot
                          of saving and reloading).  Other than that, it's
                          fun with a lot of action.  So enjoy it!
